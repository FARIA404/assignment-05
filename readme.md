 What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

 Ans: getElementById() selects only one item from the HTML document only by using one unique ID name.
 getElementsByClassName() selects multiple items from the HTML document which shares the same name.
